v0.3

-added SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, static priorities
-updated documentation
-included some scheduler overview (sched-design.txt)
-misc typo-fixes
-added Makefile for fast compiling / installing
-fixed logical errors in CHECK_RANGE_PRIO, CHECK_RANGE_POLICY
	(must've been quite late ;-)


Sat Aug 10 16:26:19 CEST 2002
v0.5

-man-page is ready and also installed via make install
-README restructured
-Wondering about the fast version-progress?
The whole package is now roughly half of what I've been dreaming of.
Still missing are e.g. some numbers.


Fri Aug 30 16:52:27 CEST 2002
v0.6 (only for me)

-minor source (-h / -v switches), README and Makefile (target: zipman,
unzipman) fixes


Wed Sep  4 10:22:31 CEST 2002
v0.7

-huge README updates with some numbers, improvements
-return-value updates: return values represent the number of failed
sched_setscheduler()-calls with 0 being everything okay.


Sun Sep 22 00:18:09 CEST 2002
v0.8

-some code work, #define SCHED_*, replace 0 with SCHED_NORMAL and such minor
stuff
-clarified the meaning of "higher" in README
-asked for util-linux inclusion


Mon Nov 11 17:26:45 CET 2002
v0.8b

-minor cleanups


Tue Aug 26 19:53:41 CEST 2003
v0.9

-implement better error handling to return exactly (well I tried at my
best knowledge) what went wrong during the sched_setscheduler()-call
-set_process() no longer automatically calls print_process()
-minor README/man-page updates regarding kernel versions 2.5 and 2.6


Sun Aug 31 16:14:35 CEST 2003
v0.95

-add support for CPU-affinity
-simplify error-handling in code
-overhaul the man-page


Tue Dec 24 21:31:59 CET 2003 (Tue Jan  6 13:37:32 CET 2004)
v0.96

-it is bad practice to have the "prerequisites" containing technical
stuff before the "about / info"-section explaing what the hell this
even is. README changed accordingly.
-moved installing into file INSTALL
-Con made a suggestion for using schedtool as a wrapper to start processes
with adjusted scheduling-params. Here you go, Con (option -e for (e)xec)!
-added parenthesis for safety in print_process in the big 
if( ... || ... || ... ) --now--> if( (...) || (...) || (...) )
-fixed an argument-BUG ("prio >= prio_min" instead of "p >= ...") in 
#define CHECK_RANGE_PRIO which did not change behaviour, but was wrong.
-made my debug-printing accessible via -DDEBUG_ME
-merry christmas


Thu Jan 15 14:41:06 CET 2004
v0.97

-changed -e(xecute) semantics from fork() to in-place exec() much like RML's
tools do it. This means that the schedtool-process will be overwritten by 
the specified command.
-added padding for better readable output; may change to dynamic spacing in 
future versions


Wed Jan 21 15:44:59 CET 2004
v0.98

-there, people, you have it: your changed cmdline parsing, no need for quoting
multi-argument-commands, just plain 
#> schedtool -3 -e cpu-hog -x1 -l2
THIS MEANS ALSO THAT YOU NO LONGER CAN MIX ARGS AND OPTIONS LIKE:
#> schedtool 1 2 3 4 -3 5 6
-restructured the help-output to be more "comprehendable" ... as an admin I get
serious pain reading it now
-and, hooray, schedtool is now silent "as that is standard unix behaviour"
unless you specify -v, which will print for each setting PID and so on, which
is indeed what I prefer to have.

Now that you have it all like you wanted, 
	send me money or even better, hot chicks.


Wed Jan 28 13:51:05 CET 2004
v0.99

-build schedtool with affinity is now the default
-changed Makefile a bit; new target no_affinity
-included support for SCHED_ISO (patch by Con Kolivas)
-update docs to reflect changes


Sun Apr  4 10:38:17 CEST 2004
v0.99.1

-support nice operations; schedtool is now capable of setting ALL scheduling
attributes!
-minor change in engine (move execute into the loop to eliminate duplicate 
code; the code is slowly getting a mess with all these checks here and there)
-documentation /man-page update; man-page now lists SCHED_*
-Makefile: new target install-doc, installs some docs into $PREFIX/share/doc/schedtool


Tue Apr 20 11:45:19 CEST 2004
v1.0

-released 1.0; more documentation updates and clarifications


Wed Jun 30 20:27:29 CEST 2004
v1.1.0

-added "NO WARRANTY" to help output
-add raw mode for the kernel hackers; allows direct input of the numerical 
policy value and changed docs accordingly.


Mon Jul  5 14:12:35 CEST 2004
v1.1.1

-added a list mode for affinity, additional to the bitmask mode
-identified 2 FIXMEs


Sun Aug  1 14:00:58 CEST 2004

-fixed one fixme: check affinity input for isdigit()
-changed the CHECK_RANGE_PRIO macro a bit for code cleanup
-moved affinity setting to the end of the loop, because may fail with ENOSYS


Sun Sep 19 19:50:09 CEST 2004
v1.1.2

-added missing padding for NICE in output
-changed custom "policy not implemented" error to "value out of range / policy
not implemented" to indicate wrong values when setting affinity or such


Tue Sep 28 20:59:42 CEST 2004
v1.2

-finally try to not break affinity-compiled binaries on non-affinity kernels
(2nd FIXME fixed)
-use getpid() instead of PID 0 (== current process) when in execute mode


Sun Oct  3 18:14:46 CEST 2004
v1.2.1

-REALLY DO NOT break affinity stuff; sched_getaffinity() suddenly returns 4 on
success instead of 0 as declared in the man-page on at least kernels 2.6.8+
-pad nice-levels correctly; they can be negative, as such we need %3d in 
printf()


Tue Oct 12 13:04:53 CEST 2004
v1.2.2

-adjust copyright
-correct typo in man-page
-correctly figure out affinity; I was missing an #include <linux/unistd.h>


Sun Oct 17 00:41:43 CEST 2004
v1.2.3

-get the affinity-ifdef-stuff right. Oh my.
-really up version to 1.2.3 (I'm getting old)
-remove superfluous break in schedtool.c::engine(), execute part
-correct another typo in man-page


Sat Nov 27 00:27:23 CET 2004
v1.2.4

-add a "probe" mode (-r), similar to sched-utils; lists prio_min/max
-add helper-functions get_prio_min_max() and print_prio_min_max()


Sat Feb  5 19:59:44 CET 2005
v1.2.5

-fix NULL pointer printing when policy is out-of-range of TAB[] ; instead,
print numeric value + <UNKNOWN>
-behave more nicely with SCHED_ISO and newer -ck kernels (inspired by cr7)


Tue Jan 17 18:50:04 CET 2006
v1.2.6

-add support for SCHED_IDLEPRIO in 2.6.16-ck kernels
-update documentation accordingly; remove old stuff about SCHED_BATCH which is
in mainline 2.6 now


Mon Sep 30 22:29:48 CEST 2006
v1.2.7

-update man-page: get section(8) right again, mention affinity list mode


Tue Nov 14 21:22:18 CET 2006
v1.2.8

-try to initialize aff_mask in a more portable way
-minor man-page update
-change SCHED_IDLE to SCHED_IDLEPRIO everywhere
-change MANPATH to $PREFIX/share/man


Sun Nov 26 15:27:12 CET 2006
v1.2.9

-spelling fixes for README; thanks to Sven Hartrumpf
-Makefile fix for installing man-page (wrong path); thanks to Adam Sampson


Fri Jul 20 20:24:24 CEST 2007
v1.2.10

-fix incorrect use of $DISTDIR in Makefile for RPM-bulding
 thanks to Adel Gadllah
-fix version to 1.2.10 (forgot for 1.2.9)


Mon Sep 15 15:35:29 CEST 2008
v1.3.0

-bring schedtool to new glibc affinity api (cpu_set_t) & make it work under new glibcs again
-bug-fix behaviour when 1 wrong PID was given - all other (valid) PIDs would run into error
