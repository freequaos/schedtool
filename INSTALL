PREREQUISITES:
--------------
This package is released under the terms of the GPL2; you can read it in the
file LICENSE. Use at your own risk.

SCHED_NORMAL, SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR are the supported out of the box
by every linux-kernel.
If you want to use special scheduling policies, get the according patches
listed below.


o SCHED_BATCH:
	Kernel 2.4.18+ with Ingo Molnar's O(1)-sched-patch
	[ http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mingo ]

	Kernel 2.6.16+ now have support for SCHED_BATCH.
	Con Kolivas also maintains patches for 2.6.
	[ http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6 ]


o SCHED_ISO and SCHED_IDLEPRIO:
	2.6.X and special patches by Con Kolivas
	[ http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/2.6 ]


o CPU-AFFINITY:
	kernel 2.5.8 or later

	RedHat9 does contain a patched kernel that supports CPU-affinity

	for 2.4.X the -aa series also contain support for CPU-affinity
	[ http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea ]


INSTALLING:
-----------
If you want to build WITH CPU-affinity support, do
	#> make

If that gives you errors about affinity or sched_setaffinity, you don't 
have your system ready for affinity - likely you have a too old glibc 
without that support.

To install, type:
	#> make install

The default prefix is /usr/local, so the binary will be put into
/usr/local/bin, the man-page into /usr/local/man/man8; additional docs are put
into $PREFIX/share/doc/schedtool.

You may change the destination in the Makefile.

You can define DEBUG (either by adding -DDEBUG to CFLAGS in the Makefile 
or specifying them to make) to get additional output.
